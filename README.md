General Instructions 
These are the instructions you will see on the final exam. They do not apply to this prob- lem set! But it is good to familiarize yourself with themanyway. 
Time allowance:   You have   THREE (3) hours   to complete   this examination.
If   you have been   granted   SoRA   extra   time and/or rest breaks,   your individual examination duration   will be   extended pro-rata.

Use   the   separate paper provided   to   do all   the necessary   rough work,   calculations   or   drafting   of answers. If   you need more paper   for rough   work, alert   the invigilators by raising   your hand. Enter         your   final   answers, answer   steps, and explanation/interpretation (as required)   in the   answer-boxes   provided   within   this   question-and-answer booklet.

Instructions   for   this Exam 
. This exam consists of 5 questions, 1]-5], and   each question has 4 sub-questions,   a]-d].   All   sub-   questions have   the   same   weight.
. You are   expected   to attempt all   questions,   there is no   selection   of   questions   to be made.
.   Use   the provided ‘scrap-paper’   to   do   your   workings and   solve   the   questions.
.   In   each answer-box,   complete   the answer   options at   the   top, and   then   complete   the ‘workings’   or ‘comments’   or ‘sketch’   sections as   appropriate.
. You   will likely need   to   select   the   important   steps in   your   workings   on   the   scrap paper and
transcribe   them into   the answer boxes. Don’t use   the boxes   for initial, rough,   workings and draft   answers.
1] Using   spectral methods in Matrix   Algebra
Consider   the   following   3 ×3 matrix

for   some constant   vectorf(-)0   = {1, -1, 1}. Find a   solution   withx(-)[0] = {0, 1, 0}?
2] Gradient-learning
Consider a   firm   that produces a   service   or   good   for   which it can charge an   exogenous   price per         unit   q   = 5, and its production   technology   gives it an output   off[K, L] = Log[K] + 3   Log[L] units   as   a   function   of   the inputs   of代 写ECON0006/0010:  Introduction to Mathematics for Economics Problem Set 3, 2025
代做程序编程语言 labour   L and   capital   K. In   order   to acquire   these inputs   the   firm   faces exogenous labor and   capital market prices   of   w   = 2 and   r   = 3/2 respectively.
. a] Find   the profit π[K, L] the   company makes as a   function   of   its labour and   capital inputs.
.   b] Determine   the   optimal inputs   {L*, K*} and   the   corresponding   optimal   output   f*   = f[K*, L*],   and   demonstrate   that it is indeed a profit   maximum   π*   .
If   we assume   that   the   firm is ‘learning’   what   their   optimal inputs are   via   gradient-learning,   then   over   time   the   firm’s   will inputs   will   evolve according   to
